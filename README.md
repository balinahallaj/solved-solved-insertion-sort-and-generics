Insertion Sort and Generics To the GenericArray.java program (provided in the lecture presentation), add a method called removeDuplicates() that removes duplicates from a previously sorted array without disrupting the order. (You must use the insertionSort() method to sort the data.) You can imagine schemes in which all the items from the place where a duplicate was discovered to the end of the array would be shifted down one space every time a duplicate was discovered, but this would lead to slow O(N2 ) time, at least when there were a lot of duplicates. In your algorithm, make sure no item is moved more than once, no matter how many duplicates there are. This will give you an algorithm with O(N) time. Question: How can this be done?
